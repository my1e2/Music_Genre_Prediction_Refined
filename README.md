Your project will culminate with a final report of at least 1,500 words, with an additional 500 words per additional student team member, posted to the class’s Medium publication. This report should cover the breadth of your work and the major accomplishments of your project to a sufficient level of detail that someone should have a decent idea of how to replicate it. In particular, be sure to justify any major design decisions you made.

If you work in a group of more than 1 student, then you should include an appendix that makes it painfully clear what part of the project was worked on by each student. If the distribution of work was complicated, a table may be a good idea.

Note this appendix and any related work are exempt from the word limit identified above.

Content:

Your final report must include the following:

Provide a succinct title for your project.

Explain the motivating question you are answering, what specific stakeholder has this question, and how the answer to this question informs a specific decision, so the reader knows what your actionable insight is.

Explain what data would be ideal for answering this question, and then explain what data you were able to collect; where did it come from, how did you clean or extend it?
What methods from the course did your project build on? This section should describe the rational behind and what methods you applied and list methods from at least two modules covered in class.

Explain what analysis you did to answer your motivating question. What models did you apply, how did you evaluate them, etc.?

Explain what answer you have for the stakeholder who needs to make a decision using the answer you have provided. This explanation is often greatly aided by charts of experiments, but you should also include a clear description of your insights.

Conclude with a discussion of the limitations of your project, the data, your analysis, ethics, etc.
